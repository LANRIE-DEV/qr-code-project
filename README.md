## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt that you can use the @import function to import fonts into your CSS files, also that it's recommended to use the @font-face rule for importing custom fonts in CSS.

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');
```

### Continued development

1. I want to devote more time to learning units and measurement parameters that contribute responsive design, units like vh (viewport height), vw(viewport width).
2. I also want to examine more of CSS FUNCTIONS and DECLARATIONS that provide seamless and soothing design. 
3. I also want to shed more light on CSS SPECIFICITY.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to understand basic syntax of complex CSS declarations.
